## sections
Home: A dummy home page for our e-commerce.

Products: The list of products that our e-commerce offers. It consumes the backend API to fetch the list of products.

Product Page: Every product in the product list page contains a button to configure the product, which redirects the user to the product page. On this page, you can configure every part of the bike. It will display information about the product and provide a set of selectors for each type of configurable option.
Every time you select an option, the rest of the selectors are updated to show the available options, taking into account the restrictions for each option.
A button to add the product to the cart is also displayed.

Cart: Section to show all the products added to the cart and proceed to payment. (Not implemented)

## Code Structure

You can find the code under the `src` folder. Two bounded contexts have been created:
- **Catalog**: Contains all code related to products
- **Cart**: Contains code related to adding products to the cart

Each bounded context contains Application, Domain, and Infrastructure folders.

`App.vue` is the initial component. It contains the menu that loads the different sections under `src/views` (Home.vue, Cart.vue, ProductEdit.vue, Products.vue).

The components use the uses cases needed, located in the src/catalog/application and src/cart/application folders.
